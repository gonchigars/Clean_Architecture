1. **Q:** What is the purpose of the `DomainValidationError` class?  
   **A:** It is a custom exception used for domain-level validation errors, allowing the application to signal when business rules are violated.

2. **Q:** In which module is `DomainValidationError` defined?  
   **A:** It is defined in the `domain/exceptions.py` module.

3. **Q:** Why would you use a custom exception like `DomainValidationError` instead of a generic exception?  
   **A:** Using a custom exception provides clear context about the error source and purpose, making error handling and debugging more precise.

4. **Q:** What is the `Bucket` class meant to represent?  
   **A:** It represents an S3 bucket as a domain entity, encapsulating the business rules for what constitutes a valid bucket.

5. **Q:** How is the `Bucket` class defined?  
   **A:** It is defined as a dataclass with fields for `name` (str), `region` (str), and `created_at` (datetime), with `created_at` defaulting to `datetime.now()`.

6. **Q:** What is the purpose of the `validate` method in the `Bucket` class?  
   **A:** It checks if the bucket’s name and region adhere to business rules and raises a `DomainValidationError` if any validation fails.

7. **Q:** Which two helper methods does `Bucket.validate` use?  
   **A:** It uses `_is_valid_bucket_name` to validate the bucket name and `_is_valid_region` to validate the AWS region.

8. **Q:** What conditions are enforced by `_is_valid_bucket_name`?  
   **A:** The name must be 3–63 characters long, contain only lowercase letters, numbers, dots, and hyphens, and must start and end with a letter or number.

9. **Q:** Why is it important that the bucket name starts and ends with a letter or number?  
   **A:** This is an AWS S3 requirement to ensure a proper and consistent naming convention.

10. **Q:** How does `_is_valid_bucket_name` check for valid characters in the bucket name?  
    **A:** It defines a set of valid characters (`"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789.-"`) and ensures every character in the name is within this set.

11. **Q:** What would happen if a bucket name contains uppercase letters?  
    **A:** The method would return `False`, leading to a `DomainValidationError` because uppercase letters are not allowed.

12. **Q:** What does `_is_valid_region` do?  
    **A:** It verifies that the provided region is within a predefined set of valid AWS regions.

13. **Q:** Which AWS regions are considered valid by `_is_valid_region`?  
    **A:** The valid regions include `'us-east-1'`, `'us-east-2'`, `'us-west-1'`, `'us-west-2'`, `'eu-west-1'`, `'eu-central-1'`, and `'ap-southeast-1'`.

14. **Q:** What happens in `validate` if the bucket name is invalid?  
    **A:** It raises a `DomainValidationError` with a message detailing the naming requirements.

15. **Q:** Why are `_is_valid_bucket_name` and `_is_valid_region` defined as static methods?  
    **A:** They do not rely on any instance-specific data and can be called without creating an instance of `Bucket`.

16. **Q:** What is the role of the `StorageRepository` interface?  
    **A:** It defines the contract for storage operations, ensuring that any concrete implementation provides methods to create a bucket and check its existence.

17. **Q:** Which methods are abstract in the `StorageRepository` interface?  
    **A:** The abstract asynchronous methods `create_bucket` and `bucket_exists`.

18. **Q:** Why are the methods in `StorageRepository` asynchronous?  
    **A:** Because operations like interacting with AWS S3 are I/O-bound, so using async helps avoid blocking the application.

19. **Q:** What is the benefit of having an abstract interface like `StorageRepository`?  
    **A:** It decouples the use cases from the specific storage implementations, making it easier to switch or mock the repository in tests.

20. **Q:** What is the purpose of the `CreateBucketUseCase` class?  
    **A:** It orchestrates the process of creating a bucket by coordinating domain validation and calling the appropriate repository methods.

21. **Q:** How does `CreateBucketUseCase` ensure a bucket does not already exist?  
    **A:** It calls `bucket_exists` on the injected storage repository and raises a `DomainValidationError` if the bucket exists.

22. **Q:** What happens if the bucket fails validation in `CreateBucketUseCase`?  
    **A:** The call to `bucket.validate()` will raise a `DomainValidationError`, and the bucket creation process will be aborted.

23. **Q:** What parameters does the `execute` method of `CreateBucketUseCase` accept?  
    **A:** It accepts `bucket_name` (str) and `region` (str).

24. **Q:** How does dependency injection work in `CreateBucketUseCase`?  
    **A:** The storage repository is injected via the constructor, allowing the use case to operate independently of the specific repository implementation.

25. **Q:** What role does `boto3` play in this codebase?  
    **A:** It is the AWS SDK for Python used to interact with AWS S3 for bucket operations in the `S3Repository`.

26. **Q:** How is the `S3Repository` class initialized?  
    **A:** It is initialized with an `AWSSettings` instance, from which it retrieves AWS credentials and region information to create a boto3 S3 client.

27. **Q:** What does the `bucket_exists` method in `S3Repository` do?  
    **A:** It checks if an S3 bucket exists by calling `head_bucket` on the boto3 client and interpreting the response or exception.

28. **Q:** How does `S3Repository.bucket_exists` handle a `ClientError` exception?  
    **A:** It checks the error code; if it is `'404'` (bucket not found), it returns `False`. Otherwise, it re-raises the exception.

29. **Q:** What does the `create_bucket` method in `S3Repository` do?  
    **A:** It attempts to create a new S3 bucket, using a special configuration for regions other than `"us-east-1"`.

30. **Q:** Why does `create_bucket` handle `"us-east-1"` differently?  
    **A:** Because when creating a bucket in `"us-east-1"`, AWS does not require a `CreateBucketConfiguration` parameter.

31. **Q:** What happens if an error occurs during bucket creation in `S3Repository.create_bucket`?  
    **A:** A `ClientError` is caught, an error message is printed, and the method returns `False`.

32. **Q:** How does `S3Repository` conform to the `StorageRepository` interface?  
    **A:** It provides asynchronous implementations of the abstract methods `bucket_exists` and `create_bucket`.

    **A:** It calls the asynchronous method `bucket_exists` on the storage repository before proceeding with bucket creation.

52. **Q:** What ensures that business rules are enforced before a bucket is created?  
    **A:** The call to `bucket.validate()` in `CreateBucketUseCase` enforces the domain rules.

53. **Q:** Can the `S3Repository` be replaced with another storage implementation?  
    **A:** Yes, because it implements the `StorageRepository` interface, any other implementation conforming to the interface can be used.

54. **Q:** What type of error does `botocore.exceptions.ClientError` represent?  
    **A:** It represents errors returned by AWS service calls, such as issues during bucket existence checks or creation.

55. **Q:** How does `S3Repository` distinguish a “bucket not found” error from other errors?  
    **A:** It checks if the error code from `ClientError` is `'404'`, which indicates the bucket does not exist.

56. **Q:** What is the significance of re-raising exceptions in `S3Repository.bucket_exists`?  
    **A:** It ensures that unexpected errors are not silently ignored, allowing higher layers to handle them appropriately.

57. **Q:** What does the `create_bucket` method in `S3Repository` return upon a successful bucket creation?  
    **A:** It returns `True` if the bucket was created successfully.

58. **Q:** Why is a print statement used in the exception block of `S3Repository.create_bucket`?  
    **A:** For simplicity in this example, though in production a logging framework should be used.

59. **Q:** What are the benefits of using a dataclass for the `Bucket` entity?  
    **A:** Dataclasses reduce boilerplate code by automatically generating methods like `__init__` and `__repr__`.

60. **Q:** What potential pitfall exists with setting `created_at = datetime.now()` in a dataclass?  
    **A:** It might be evaluated at the time of class definition rather than during instance creation; using a `default_factory` is generally preferred.

61. **Q:** How can you ensure `created_at` is set at instance creation time?  
    **A:** By using `field(default_factory=datetime.now)` from the `dataclasses` module.

62. **Q:** Why is dependency injection used in the FastAPI application?  
    **A:** It decouples components, making the code easier to test and maintain by allowing dependencies to be swapped out as needed.

    **A:** FastAPI handles HTTP request routing, dependency injection, and response generation, serving as the web API framework.

95. **Q:** How does the `CreateBucketRequest` model enhance API security?  
    **A:** By validating and enforcing the structure of incoming data, it prevents malformed or malicious input from reaching the business logic.

96. **Q:** Can you provide an example of a valid bucket name based on the validation rules?  
    **A:** Yes—for example, `"my.bucket-01"` meets the length and character requirements and starts/ends with an alphanumeric character.

97. **Q:** What is an example of an invalid bucket name and why is it invalid?  
    **A:** `"My_Bucket!"` is invalid because it contains uppercase letters, an underscore, and an exclamation mark, all of which violate the allowed character rules.

98. **Q:** How does the code demonstrate the principles of Clean Architecture?  
    **A:** It separates concerns across distinct layers (domain, use cases, infrastructure, and API), making components independent, testable, and maintainable.

99. **Q:** How might you add logging for successful bucket creation?  
    **A:** By integrating a logging library and adding log statements in the `S3Repository.create_bucket` method or in the use case after a successful operation.

100. **Q:** What is the overall flow of a bucket creation request through this codebase?  
     **A:** An HTTP POST request is received by FastAPI at `/bucket` and validated by `CreateBucketRequest`. The request is passed to `CreateBucketUseCase`, which checks if the bucket exists, validates the `Bucket` entity, and then calls `S3Repository` to create the bucket on AWS S3. Depending on success or failure, an appropriate HTTP response is returned to the client.

Below are 50 questions (and answers) that explain the code flow step-by-step:

1. **Q:** What is the entry point for initiating the bucket creation process?  
   **A:** The entry point is the FastAPI endpoint defined in `api/main.py` at the `/bucket` POST route.

2. **Q:** How does the endpoint receive and validate incoming request data?  
   **A:** It uses the `CreateBucketRequest` Pydantic model to validate that the incoming JSON contains a non-empty `bucket_name`.

3. **Q:** What mechanism does FastAPI use to inject dependencies into the endpoint?  
   **A:** FastAPI’s `Depends` function is used to automatically inject dependencies like `AWSSettings`, `S3Repository`, and `CreateBucketUseCase`.

4. **Q:** Which function supplies the AWS configuration settings?  
   **A:** The `get_settings()` function provides an `AWSSettings` instance with the AWS credentials and region.

5. **Q:** How is the storage repository instance provided to the endpoint?  
   **A:** The `get_storage_repository` function creates an `S3Repository` using the provided AWS settings and injects it via dependency injection.

6. **Q:** What role does the `CreateBucketUseCase` play in the overall flow?  
   **A:** It encapsulates the business logic for creating a bucket, coordinating validations and repository operations.

7. **Q:** How is the `CreateBucketUseCase` instance provided to the endpoint?  
   **A:** It is created by the `get_bucket_use_case` function, which injects the repository instance, and is then provided via FastAPI’s dependency system.

8. **Q:** What is the first business rule that the use case enforces?  
   **A:** It checks whether a bucket with the provided name already exists by calling the repository’s `bucket_exists` method.

9. **Q:** What happens if the bucket already exists?  
   **A:** The use case raises a `DomainValidationError`, stopping the process and returning an error to the API.

10. **Q:** After verifying the bucket does not exist, what is the next step?  
    **A:** The use case creates a new `Bucket` instance using the provided bucket name and region.

11. **Q:** How does the newly created `Bucket` instance ensure it meets business rules?  
    **A:** It calls its `validate()` method, which checks the bucket name and region against defined rules.

12. **Q:** What specific validations occur within `Bucket.validate()`?  
    **A:** It verifies that the bucket name is between 3–63 characters, uses only allowed characters, and that the region is one of the predefined valid AWS regions.

13. **Q:** What happens if the `Bucket` instance fails validation?  
    **A:** A `DomainValidationError` is raised, preventing further processing.

14. **Q:** Once the bucket passes validation, what is the next operation?  
    **A:** The use case calls the repository’s `create_bucket` method to attempt to create the bucket in AWS S3.

15. **Q:** How does the `S3Repository` interact with AWS S3 to check bucket existence?  
    **A:** It uses the boto3 client’s `head_bucket` method to verify if the bucket exists.

16. **Q:** How does the repository determine that a bucket does not exist?  
    **A:** If a `ClientError` with error code `'404'` is caught during `head_bucket`, it returns `False`.

17. **Q:** How does the repository handle errors that are not “bucket not found”?  
    **A:** For other errors, it re-raises the exception so that higher layers can handle them.

18. **Q:** What boto3 method is used by the repository to create a bucket?  
    **A:** The repository uses boto3’s `create_bucket` method.

19. **Q:** How is bucket creation handled differently for the `"us-east-1"` region?  
    **A:** For `"us-east-1"`, the repository calls `create_bucket` without a `CreateBucketConfiguration` parameter.

20. **Q:** How is bucket creation handled for regions other than `"us-east-1"`?  
    **A:** It passes a `CreateBucketConfiguration` dictionary specifying the `LocationConstraint` with the region.

21. **Q:** What does the repository return upon successful bucket creation?  
    **A:** It returns `True` to indicate that the bucket was created successfully.

22. **Q:** What happens if an error occurs during bucket creation in the repository?  
    **A:** The error is caught, an error message is printed (or logged), and `False` is returned.

23. **Q:** How does the use case react to the repository returning `False`?  
    **A:** The use case simply returns the boolean result back to the API endpoint.

24. **Q:** How does the API endpoint handle a `False` result from the use case?  
    **A:** It raises an HTTP 500 error using `HTTPException` with a message stating that bucket creation failed.

25. **Q:** What is the final step in the API endpoint if bucket creation is successful?  
    **A:** It returns a JSON response with a success message and the AWS region.

26. **Q:** How are domain validation errors communicated back to the client?  
    **A:** They are caught in the API endpoint and converted into HTTP 400 responses via `HTTPException`.

27. **Q:** What is the purpose of making functions asynchronous in this flow?  
    **A:** Async functions allow non-blocking I/O operations, such as network calls to AWS, which improves performance and scalability.

28. **Q:** Which parts of the code are asynchronous?  
    **A:** The repository methods (`bucket_exists` and `create_bucket`) and the use case’s `execute` method are asynchronous.

29. **Q:** How does the use case await asynchronous operations?  
    **A:** It uses the `await` keyword when calling async methods from the repository.

30. **Q:** How does dependency injection benefit the overall code flow?  
    **A:** It decouples component instantiation from usage, making the system modular and easier to test or reconfigure.

31. **Q:** How is the AWS region passed through the layers of the application?  
    **A:** The AWS region is part of the `AWSSettings` instance, which is passed into the repository and then used in both the use case and the repository’s methods.

32. **Q:** What ensures that the correct AWS credentials are used during bucket operations?  
    **A:** The credentials are provided by the `AWSSettings` instance, which is used to initialize the boto3 client in `S3Repository`.

33. **Q:** At what point in the flow is the business logic separated from AWS-specific code?  
    **A:** The use case encapsulates business logic and calls an abstract repository interface, keeping AWS-specific interactions isolated in the `S3Repository`.

34. **Q:** How does the application ensure that only valid buckets reach the AWS S3 API?  
    **A:** Domain validation in the `Bucket.validate()` method stops invalid buckets from proceeding further.

35. **Q:** What happens if an exception occurs during the AWS S3 API call?  
    **A:** The exception is caught in the repository, and depending on its type, it is either handled (returning `False`) or re-raised to be handled in the API layer.

36. **Q:** How does the code flow manage error propagation from the repository to the API layer?  
    **A:** Errors raised in the repository (or use case) are caught in the API endpoint, where they are converted into HTTP error responses.

37. **Q:** What role does the Pydantic model play in the initial stages of the flow?  
    **A:** It validates the structure and basic constraints of the incoming request data before any business logic is executed.

38. **Q:** How does the system prevent a duplicate bucket from being created?  
    **A:** The use case first calls `bucket_exists` to check for an existing bucket and raises an error if it already exists.

39. **Q:** What is the significance of using a custom exception like `DomainValidationError`?  
    **A:** It clearly distinguishes business rule violations from other errors and allows for tailored error handling in the API layer.

40. **Q:** How does the use case integrate domain validation with repository calls?  
    **A:** It validates the bucket first by calling `bucket.validate()` and then proceeds to create the bucket if validation passes.

41. **Q:** Which layer in the application is responsible for making decisions based on business rules?  
    **A:** The domain layer (via the `Bucket` entity) and the use case layer (via `CreateBucketUseCase`) enforce business rules.

42. **Q:** How is the flow of data maintained from the API layer to AWS S3?  
    **A:** Data flows from the validated API request through the use case and domain layers, and finally the repository translates it into AWS S3 API calls.

43. **Q:** What happens if a request with an invalid bucket name is received?  
    **A:** The `Bucket.validate()` method will fail, a `DomainValidationError` is raised, and the API returns an HTTP 400 error.

44. **Q:** How is the asynchronous bucket existence check integrated into the flow?  
    **A:** The use case awaits the async `bucket_exists` method before proceeding with bucket creation.

45. **Q:** In what order are dependencies instantiated during a bucket creation request?  
    **A:** First, `AWSSettings` is created, then `S3Repository` is instantiated with those settings, followed by the creation of `CreateBucketUseCase` with the repository injected.

46. **Q:** How does the use case handle the result from the repository’s create operation?  
    **A:** It returns the boolean result (`True` for success, `False` for failure) back to the API endpoint.

47. **Q:** What is the API endpoint’s role when an exception is raised during processing?  
    **A:** It catches the exception, determines the appropriate HTTP status code (400 for domain errors, 500 for other exceptions), and returns an error response.

48. **Q:** How does the design of the code flow promote testability?  
    **A:** By isolating the business logic in the use case and domain layers and using dependency injection, components can be easily mocked and tested independently.

49. **Q:** How does the overall code flow ensure that the system is scalable and maintainable?  
    **A:** The separation of concerns between the API, use case, domain, and infrastructure layers, along with asynchronous operations and clear error handling, enhances scalability and maintainability.

50. **Q:** Can you summarize the complete flow from receiving a request to responding to the client?  
    **A:** A POST request is received and validated by FastAPI using Pydantic. The request data is injected into the `CreateBucketUseCase`, which first checks if the bucket exists. If not, it creates a new `Bucket`, validates it against business rules, and then calls the `S3Repository` to create the bucket in AWS S3. The repository handles AWS API interactions and returns a result, which is then relayed by the use case to the API endpoint. Finally, the API endpoint returns a success message or an error response based on the outcome.
